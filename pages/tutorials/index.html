						A great all around text editor with support for many plugins and a built in SFTP client. Easily display you babbage acccount directories and download, edit, upload and create all types of files with a simple to use graphical interface. Already about half the class uses this but just in case someone diden't know the steps to setting it up to your babbage account.

						Probably my favorite text editor that has great syntax highlighting and auto completion compared to notepad++. Very sleak interface aswell. Drawbacks are that the SFTP client that lets you connect to babbage is a bit harder to use and is a third party package. Also it's always technically in trail, you always will have access to all it's features except every ten saves or so it will pop up a message asking you to pay, kinda annoying but not a big deal.
